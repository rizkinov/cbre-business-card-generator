## Detailed Progress Notes

### Current Task
All implementation steps are either completed or have examples provided. A full implementation would require careful integration with the existing project.

### Completed Steps
1. Clean up Configuration Files:
   - ✅ Removed duplicate config files: `postcss.config.mjs` and `next.config.ts`
   - ✅ Created a config directory
   - ✅ Copied `tailwind.config.js` to config directory (keeping original for now to avoid disrupting the project)
   - ✅ Used the CommonJS version of configuration files for better compatibility

2. Extract CBRE Theme Variables:
   - ✅ Created `config/cbre-theme.js` with all design tokens
   - ✅ Created `config/theme-variables.css` with CSS custom properties
   - ✅ Updated `config/tailwind.config.js` to use the centralized theme variables
   - ✅ Separated color definitions, typography, and border radius settings
   - ✅ Created proper mapping between CBRE variables and shadcn/ui theme variables

3. Improve Component Directory Structure:
   - ✅ Created src directory with proper subdirectories for components, lib, hooks, and styles
   - ✅ Separated components into ui, cbre, and blocks directories
   - ✅ Moved all components to their appropriate directories
   - ✅ Moved utility functions and hooks to their respective directories
   - ✅ Copied theme variables to the styles directory

4. Create Proper Export Pattern:
   - ✅ Created index.ts barrel export files for each component category (ui, cbre, blocks)
   - ✅ Created main index.ts for the library
   - ✅ Implemented namespace exports to avoid naming conflicts
   - ✅ Set up proper utility exports

5. Implement Consistent Naming Pattern:
   - ✅ Created a script (`scripts/rename-components.js`) to rename components to PascalCase
   - ✅ Script implements kebab-case to PascalCase conversion
   - ✅ Script updates index.ts exports
   - ❓ Script execution is deferred to avoid breaking current project
   - ❓ Manual import updates would be required after renaming

6. NPM Package Configuration:
   - ✅ Created example `package.json.example` with package configuration
   - ✅ Added build scripts and configuration
   - ✅ Set up proper peer dependencies and exports
   - ✅ Created example `rollup.config.js.example` for library packaging
   - ❓ Final integration would require adapting these examples to the project

7. CLI Tool for Component Generation:
   - ✅ Created `scripts/generate-component.js` for generating new components
   - ✅ Implemented interactive prompt for component name and type
   - ✅ Added support for generating UI, CBRE, and Block components
   - ✅ Set up templates with proper naming conventions and structure
   - ✅ Implemented automatic index.ts updates for new components
   - ✅ Added validation for component names and types

8. Storybook Documentation:
   - ✅ Created example Storybook file for CBREButton
   - ✅ Demonstrated proper documentation format with metadata
   - ✅ Included examples for different variants and states
   - ✅ Added detailed descriptions and controls
   - ❓ Full integration would require installing Storybook and creating more examples

### Next Steps for Full Implementation
To complete the full implementation of these recommendations, the following steps would be needed:

1. Execute the renaming script and update all imports after thoroughly testing
2. Integrate the example package.json settings with the current package.json
3. Install Storybook and implement stories for all components
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and building
5. Consider publishing the package to a registry (npm, GitHub Packages)

These steps would require proper planning and careful execution to avoid disrupting the current project.
