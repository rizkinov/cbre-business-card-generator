# Calibre Fonts

Place your official CBRE Calibre font files here:

- `calibre-web-light.woff2`
- `calibre-web-light.woff`
- `calibre-web-regular.woff2`
- `calibre-web-regular.woff`

**Note**: These fonts are used for all body text on the business card including titles, company information, and contact details. They provide the clean, modern sans-serif appearance that matches CBRE's brand guidelines.

**Current Fallback**: Inter (Google Fonts)

Once you add the official fonts, the application will automatically use them instead of the fallback fonts.
